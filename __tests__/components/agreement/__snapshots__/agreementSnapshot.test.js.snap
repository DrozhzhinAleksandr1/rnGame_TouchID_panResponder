We do not and will not manage your Transactions, nor will we advise you on your Transactions.  You understand and acknowledge that we assume no responsibility whatsoever for your Transactions.  You understand and acknowledge that we assume no responsibility whatsoever for monitoring your Transactions.  If at any time we choose, in our sole discretion, to monitor your Transactions for any reason, we assume no responsibility for your Transactions and have no obligation to advise you regarding your Transactions.  Without limiting the foregoing, we are under no obligation to make margin calls or to close out any of your open positions. 


Customers are given the opportunity to perform trading operations on the phone during trading hours. 


To execute trading operations over the phone Company’s employees may provide technical assistance to Clients in the opening/closing / changing parameters of transactions  (take profit, stop loss) on behalf of Clients on the phone. If customers do not agree with the use of the Service of the Company, they may notify the Company or not to use this Service. 


In order to open / close / change transaction or request setting the order, the Customer must contact the Customer Support department (account manager). 


The Client also has the right to ask the Company for obtaining the regular technical assistance in opening/closing / changing transactions using the phone. In this case, the Company's account manager performs regular telephone communication with the Client in order to facilitate the Customer in performing transactions. 


When opening transactions using the phone you need to: 


1) Identify yourself by entering the surname, first name, patronymic and login account.


2) If necessary answer the possible control question (date of birth, and other personal data provided to the Company by the Client). 


3) Confirm the conditions to open (option type, position size, direction, the expiration of the option) the transaction (sell-buy), take profit, stop loss (if necessary). The account manager reports to the Client the current rate of the asset and receives the Client's consent to the opening of the transaction at a specified rate.


When closing transactions by the phone you need to: 


1) Identify yourself by entering the surname, first name, patronymic and login account.


2) If necessary answer the possible control question (date of birth, and other personal data provided to the Company by the Client).


3) Accurately specify the transaction that needs to be closed.


When changing transactions by the phone you need to: 


1) Identify yourself by entering the surname, first name, patronymic and login account.


2) If necessary answer the possible control question (date of birth, and other personal data provided to the Company by the Client).


3) Accurately specify the transaction whose parameters you want to change, and specify what changes need to be implemented.


Before entering into transactions by phone the margin balance required to open a trade should be checked. 


In order to ensure the quality of service, telephone calls can be recorded. You agree that all communications between you and Company’s staff will be recorded without preliminary notice. You acknowledge that these records and the results of their transcription can be used as evidence in case of disputes. 


The Client agrees that the remote method of opening / closing / changing transactions from the date of receipt of the command / Client's consent to the opening / closing / changing transactions may be fluctuations in the rate of the asset. The Client accepts these terms and undertakes not to have any claims on such fluctuations in the case of a remote method of opening / closing / changing transactions. 


Confirmation of execution of the Client's instructions when opening / closing / changing transactions for the Company will be the agreement on the method of opening / closing / changing transactions, expressed through the adoption of the terms of this Agreement, as well as recording a phone conversation with the Client. 


The use described herein of a method of performing trading operations does not lead to the conclusion by the Company and the Client any separate contract, including the contract of trust management, etc. All trading operations performed using technical assistance from the Company are made by the Client and at the Client’s discretion. The Company, as in all other cases, is not responsible for the results of these transactions. The calculation of the prices, payouts or losses related to Transactions at the time the Transaction is opened and closed will be based on our estimate of actual market prices and the expected level of interest rates, implied volatilities and other market conditions during the life of the Transaction.  These values are based on complex arithmetic calculations as determined by us in our sole discretion.  These calculations include a spread in favor of us, which means that the values involved may differ substantially from prices available on primary markets where similar transactions are conducted. 


We do not support physical delivery of currency (or any other securities) in the settlement of any Transactions.  Any gains or losses you experience as a result of a Transaction will be deposit to or withdrawn from your Account after your Transaction has been completed. 


You acknowledge and agree that in the event that any Transaction is completed at prices that do not reflect actual market prices due to any reason, including an undetected programming error or glitch or any other reason which results in a mispricing, we reserve the right to cancel or roll-back such Transactions.

      a) Deposit bonus.


The given bonus is provided by the Company to the clients when the Client deposits his/her account. The amount of the bonus is defined by the Company as a percentage of the amount of the money which the Client deposits. 


The given bonus presupposes the following volume of trade by the client. 


Each 1000$ of bonus money the volume of trade must reach: 


10,000,000$ volume of trade for each bonus 1,000$ for the total bonus of up to 10000$; 


20,000,000$ volume of trade for each bonus 1,000$ for the total bonus of 10000$ to 30000$; 


30,000,000$ volume of trade for each bonus 1,000$ for the total bonus of more than 30000$. 


In case the Client has two or more accounts in the Company, trading volume for the bonus must be reached for each account in accordance with the amount of the bonus transferred and trading volume of all deals made on these accounts. In case the Client has several bonuses the withdrawal of the bonus and the income from trading activities is not allowed until the volume of trade is reached. 


The volume of trade does not include the transactions which are opened in the mixed way, scalping transactions, and transactions which last less than three minutes. In case there is no trading activity on the account during any period longer than three months from the moment the bonus is deposited and till the moment the volume of trade must be reached, the company has the right to debit the bonus money as well as the whole income on the account of the client for the given period without any notice or agreement with the client. 


In those cases when during any period more than 3 months from the day the bonus is credited until the volume of trade condition is fulfilled: 


- there is no activity on the Client's trading account; 


- the current balance of the Client's account (with opened positions) does not exceed the amount of the bonus received from the Company; 


the Company has the right to debit bonus funds, as well as all income received on the Client's account with bonus funds without warning and without receiving any consent from the Client. 


In case there are any suspicions of the fraud with the purpose to reach the necessary volume of trade or use of the bonus, the trading account of the client can be adjusted. 


The withdrawal of the bonus and the income from trading activities is not allowed until the volume of trade is reached. When the volume of trade is reached, the whole balance of the account together with the bonuses, deposits and income can be withdrawn without any limitations. There are no time limits for reaching the volume of trade for the bonus. 


In case the Client withdraws the money from the account before he/she fulfills the conditions on the volume of trade for the bonus, all the opened positions on the Client’s account are closed and the money left on the account of the client is cleared in accordance with the following formula: 


Account balance = current account balance – the amount of the bonus/es provided – total income obtained by the client since the time the bonus was activated for all closed positioned which were opened after the bonus had been activated (positive total income only). 


b) Advance bonus.


The given bonus is provided by the Company to the clients upon the agreement with the clients before the clients deposit their accounts, but on the condition of further depositing the account by the clients. 


When such a bonus is provided, the Company and the client agree upon: 


- the amount of the bonus;


- the terms when the client shall deposit the account (if this issue is not agreed upon, the client and the company define this term as 7 calendar days);


- the sum that the client shall deposit his/her account with.


If the client does not deposit the account with the necessary some of money and in due time, the Company has the right to debit the advance bonus provided, as well as the whole amount of income, which was obtained with the help of the Client’s account during the time period from the provision of the advance bonus till debiting the bonus money by the Company. 


Until the client deposits the account with the agreed sum of money or until the bonus is debited by the Company, the client’s account is blocked by the Company. 


The conditions for the trade volume for the advance bonus are similar to those of the deposit bonus. The company has the right to change and/or cancel the bonus and special offers program at any time. 


The conditions of the special offers and bonuses, provided by the Company, are defined by the Company and the clients are informed about them additionally. If no other conditions are agreed upon by the Company and the client and the offer concerns money bonuses for the clients, the conditions about the amount of trade, the possibility to withdraw the money from the account and other rules are defined in the way, presupposed for the deposit bonus.

      The Compliance Officer will act as an impartial investigator and will attempt to resolve the complaint with the client within 7 days of the acknowledgement letter being sent. If the complaint cannot be resolved within the 7day period then a more detailed letter will be written to the client explaining this fact and, if necessary, seeking further information. The Compliance Officer will then have an additional 7 days to resolve the complaint. 


If the complaint is more complex and takes longer than 28 days, we will communicate the reasons for the delay.
